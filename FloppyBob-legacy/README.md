# FloppyBob

This game is a Flappy Bird remake. Albeit not a good one, it is still the first "working" game I made.

Learning Unity and C# for this was hard. And even though most of the code is "copied", there are still some features that I added myself - and I am proud to display this as my first Unity project of many more to come!
